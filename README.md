# Alas

Alas is my personal website made for the student server at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. The webiste is hosted at [http://alas.matf.bg.ac.rs/~mi17145](http://alas.matf.bg.ac.rs/~mi17145)

## Building and testing

### Cloning the project

    git clone https://github.com/VladimirV99/Alas.git

### Installing dependencies

Before using the code you need to install the dependencies. Fortunately NPM does this for us

    npm install

### Running tests

    npm run test

### Building for development

By building for development the output isn't minified which makes debugging a lot easier

    npm run dev

### Building for production

By building for production the output is minified and optimized for deployment

    npm run build

## Tools

### Converter

Radix converter and signed number representation converter tools that provide step-by-step instructions on how to do the conversions by hand.

### Aritmetic

Collection of algorithms for arithmetic operations that are hardware implemented in CPUs. The collection includes algorithms for unsigned multiplication and division, regular and modified Booth's algorithm for signed multiplication and an algorithm for signed division. All of them provide step-by-step instructions for calculating the solution.

### IEEE754 Converter

Utility for converting to and from floating point numbers represented in the IEEE754 standard, including algorithms for performing basic arithmetic operations on IEEE754 numbers. All algorithms provide step-by-step instructions for calculating the solution.

### Error Correction

CRC and Hamming Single Error Correction encoder and decoder with step-by-step instructions for performing the operations.
